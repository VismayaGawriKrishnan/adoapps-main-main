# VioraAI — Next-Generation AI Assistant

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Existing AI tools lack:
- **Contextual understanding** — conversations feel disconnected and stateless
- **Adaptability** — rigid responses that ignore user intent or domain
- **Accessibility** — interfaces too complex for non-technical users
- **Workflow integration** — single-purpose tools that can't chain actions

## 💡 Solution — VioraAI

VioraAI closes this gap with a fluid, intelligent assistant that:
- Maintains **full conversational context** across every message
- **Adapts its tone and format** based on query type (academic, casual, business)
- Streams responses **in real time** for a natural, human-like feel
- Runs on a **zero-friction UI** accessible to all users

## 🤖 Google AI Usage

### Tools / Models Used
- **Google Gemini API** — core language model
- **Gemini Flash / Pro** — optimised for fast multi-turn dialogue
- **Google AI Studio** — prompt engineering and API key management
- **Google stitch** - for designing ui and logo

### How AI Is Integrated
1. **Conversational Engine** — Full chat history is passed to Gemini on every request, enabling coherent multi-turn understanding
2. **System Prompt Layer** — A carefully engineered system prompt defines VioraAI's persona, tone, and behaviour
3. **Streaming Responses** — Uses Gemini's streaming API so users see answers forming in real time
4. **Adaptive Intelligence** — Gemini self-selects response format (bullets, prose, structured) based on query context
